      "message": "Thanks for this Bogdan, one thing I want to note is originally I had planned to split some of the tasks files based on release due to all the additional changes introduced in 17.  Specifically I plan on updating [1] to be two separate task yamls e.g. pre16.yml and pre17.yml, with the call being updated in [2].  This is to account for the new node, network, and vip provisioning steps needed for 17.  The way you have setup post_tasks.sh can handle either release with your changes, but if you think it\u0027s easier to maintain I\u0027m also ok with having a post_tasks_16.sh and post_tasks_17.sh.\n\n\n[1] https://github.com/rhos-infra/tripleo-config-changes/blob/master/tasks/multi_cell_v2_osp16/pre.yml\n[2] https://github.com/rhos-infra/tripleo-config-changes/blob/master/tasks/multi_cell_v2_osp16/main.yml",
